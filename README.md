# Getting Started

This sample displays growth chart (child's stature percentile based on age.) based on the following data:<br>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/zscore/statage.csv">https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/zscore/statage.csv/</a>

I have deployed this web application on heroku and this is the link(just in case you don't have maven environment set up in your machine):<br>
<a href="https://ornl-app-ce4dd35f9511.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://ornl-app-ce4dd35f9511.herokuapp.com</a>


This sample demonstrates:
* Implementing data visualization application using J2EE technologies
* Use of cloud development platforms
* Use of classes
* Use of thymeleaf(Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 template engine) and Bootstrap(HTML and CSS based design templates)
* Input and output operations
* Unit test with Mockito (a library that enables writing tests using the mocking approach)
* Use of Javadoc for documentation
* Use of Maven build
* Use of Git for version control
* Use of READMEs for out of source docs

## Build Instructions

* compile the project and generate target folder<br>
mvn compile


* Tests<br>
mvn clean install


* Cleaning<br>
mvn clean


* Builds and packages(the resulting WAR file into the target directory-without running the unit tests during the build)<br>
mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true


* Execution (triggers the download of Apache Tomcat and initializes the startup of Tomcat.)<br>
mvn spring-boot:run

When the log shows the line containing â€˜Started Application', this web application is ready to be queried via the browser at the address http://localhost:8080/
This default URL displays my daughter's height for age. Other input can be entered by the following:<br>
http://localhost:8080/chart/{ageInMonth}/{height}/{sex}<br>
* {sex} -> 1:boy, 2:girl
